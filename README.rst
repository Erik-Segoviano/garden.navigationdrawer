ActionSlider
============

ActionSlider is a kivy widget to duplicate the popular android
behaviour of having a panel hidden on the left of the screen, which
can be made visible by sliding from the left. The panel usually would
contain (e.g.) a list of menu items, but ActionSlider lets the user
add any kivy widget for the role of side panel and main panel.
