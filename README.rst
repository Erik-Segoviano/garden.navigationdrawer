ActionPanel
============

ActionPanel is a kivy widget to duplicate the popular android
behaviour of having a panel hidden on the left of the screen, which
can be made visible by sliding from the left.

The panel usually would contain (e.g.) a list of menu items, but
ActionPanel lets the user add any kivy widget for the role of side
panel and main panel. A normal usage might be to have a GridLayout
containing a list of menu items to navigate the app.
